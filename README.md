- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bischcoin
- 👀 I’m interested in catalyzing environmental justice through social governance 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what Github is :p   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where my experience in sales & supply chain may be of value. I could be a helpful bridge to meatspace on some of these projects.
